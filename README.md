# Garment_Worker_Performance
This project is to track, analyse and predict the productivity performance of the working teams in their factories. This was completed as part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP). We have performed five types of machine learning algorithms namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest , K-Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine. From the analysis and implementation of the algorithms, we found the best result in Random Forest Algorithm for the train-test ratio 70-30 with least mean absolute error as 0.07696.
